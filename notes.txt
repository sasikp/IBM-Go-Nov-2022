Methodology:
    * No powerpoints
    * 100% hands-on driven class
    * At least 50% of the class should have solved the assignments for us to continue
    * Be prepared to showcase your assignment solution

Etiquitte:
    * No allocated time for Q&A
    * Interuptions are most welcome
    * Inform if you leave the class for any reason

Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
    2. Resource light
    3. Error Handling
    4. Concurrency

    1. Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
        * No access modifiers (No public, private, protected etc)
        * No Classes (only structs)
        * No inheritance (only composition)
        * No Exceptions (only errors [values])
        * No "try catch finally"
        * No reference types (everything is a value in go)
        * No pointer arithmetic
        * No implicit type conversion
        * Has a builtin Garbage Collector

    2. Light Weight
        - Compiles to Native Code
        - No need for app servers
        - Performance on par with C++

    3. Concurrency
        - Goroutine (4 KB) / OS Thread (2 MB on linux)
            1000s of goroutines using fewer OS thread(s)
        - Has a builtin Scheduler to schedule the goroutines
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            "go" keyword, "chan" data type, "range" & "select case" constructs
        - SDK support
            sync package
            sync/atomic package

    Documentation for GO Standard Library
        https://pkg.go.dev/std

    To run a go program
        go run <program.go>

    To create a build
        go build <program.go>
        go build -o <buildname> <program.go>    

    To execute the build 
        In mac -> ./<buildname>
        IN windows -> <buildname> 

    To list all the environment variables
        go env

    To get the value of the given environment variables
        go env <env_variable>
        go env <env_variable-1> <env_variable-2>

    To change the environment variables
        go env -w <env_variable-1>=<value_1> <env_variable-2>=<value_2>

    Envrionment Variables for Cross Compilation
        GOOS & GOARCH
    
    To get the list of platforms for cross compilation
        go tool dist list 
            (will list the possible combination of GOOS/GOARCH)
    
    On Mac & Linux
        GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <program.go>

Assignment-1:  
    Print all the prime numbers between 3 and 100

Assignment-2:
    Display the following menu
		1. Add
		2. Subtract
		3. Multiply
		4. Divide
		5. Exit
	Accept the user choice
	If the user choice is 1 - 4
		accept 2 numbers from the user
		perform the corresponding operation
		print the result
		display the menu again

	If the user choice = 5
		print "Thank you"
		exit the application

	If the user choice is NOT 1 - 5
		print "Invalid choice"
		display the menu again
