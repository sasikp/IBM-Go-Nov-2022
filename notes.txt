Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
    2. Resource light
    3. Error Handling
    4. Concurrency

    1. Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
        * No access modifiers (No public, private, protected etc)
        * No Classes (only structs)
        * No inheritance (only composition)
        * No Exceptions (only errors [values])
        * No "try catch finally"
        * No reference types (everything is a value in go)
        * No pointer arithmetic
        * No implicit type conversion
        * Has a builtin Garbage Collector

    2. Light Weight
        - Compiles to Native Code
        - No need for app servers
        - Performance on par with C++

    3. Concurrency
        - Goroutine (4 KB) / OS Thread (2 MB on linux)
            1000s of goroutines using fewer OS thread(s)
        - Has a builtin Scheduler to schedule the goroutines
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            "go" keyword, "chan" data type, "range" & "select case" constructs
        - SDK support
            sync package
            sync/atomic package
